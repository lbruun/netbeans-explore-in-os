## How it works

The action simply uses [Desktop.open()](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.desktop/java/awt/Desktop.html#open(java.io.File)) 
and should therefore work equally well on any platform supported by AWT/Swing.

## Heritage

The plugin is somewhat similar to some previous plugins by various authors, now no longer maintained, most notably the Explore-from-here plugin.

However, the plugin presented here is a lot simpler than its predecessors and therefore easier to maintain.
